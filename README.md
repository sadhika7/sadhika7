I recently graduated from University of Mississippi with a major in Computer Science and a minor in General Business. During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity of successfully completing two internships: as a Data Analyst Intern at University of Mississippi and Software Engineer Intern at Ericsson. Through my internship experiences and side projects, I have developed an immense interest in software development and data analytics. I am looking for recent grad full-time opportunities in Software Engineering.
