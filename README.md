I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Virginia Tech with specializations in Software Engineering and Data Analytics. During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity of successfully completing two internships: as a Data Analyst Intern at University of Mississippi and Software Engineer Intern at Ericsson. Through my internship experiences and side projects, I have developed an immense interest in software development and data analytics.
