#Hi, I'm Swati!

- I recently graduated from University of Mississippi in Computer Science and have a minor in General Business. During my undergraduate years, I had the chance of successfully completing two internships: Data Analyst Intern at University of Mississippi and Software Engineer Intern at Ericsson. Through my internship experiences and side projects, I have developed an immense interest in software development and data analytics. Thus, I am looking for recent grad full-time opportunities in Software Engineering.
